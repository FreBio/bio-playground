This directory contains some scripts to create benchmarking data for the
Mutalyzer [1] batch position converter and name checker from VCF files.

First take a VCF file (preferably from an exome sequencing experiment) and
generate variant descriptions in HGVS notation using hg19 chromosomal
positioning. Feed the result to the Mutalyzer batch position converter. Now
filter the result to keep all variants in coding sequences of genes. Feed the
result to the Mutalyzer batch name checker.

Example workflow:

    ./vcf_to_hgvs.py sample.vcf > sample.hgvs
    # Feed sample.hgvs to position converter, get sample.converted
    ./filter_cds.py sample.converted > sample.cds.hgvs
    # Feed sample.cds.hgvs to the name checker

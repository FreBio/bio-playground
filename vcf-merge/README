Merging VCF files
=================

Experimented with VCF files from GoNL variant calls by BGI.


For SNPs
--------

Using vcf-merge from vcftools [1]. Note that the VCF files must be sorted by
position. Example:

    vcf-sort sample.vcf > sample.sorted.vcf

Compress and index each VCF file:

    bgzip -c sample.vcf > sample.vcf.gz
    tabix -p vcf sample.vcf.gz

Now merge them:

    vcf-merge *.vcf.gz > merged.vcf

The result is a merged VCF file with positional duplicates. Each input file
gets an allele column. For example, the inputs (simplified)

     chr1 3432 G T 0/1
     chr1 3432 G C 1/1
     chr1 3432 G T 1/0

will yield (simplified):

     chr1 3432 G T,C 0/1 2/2 1/0

Note that vcf-merge will assign column names to the samples based on the input
filenames, so having sensibly named files will help. It seems information like
coverage is lost (the highest coverage value is copied).

Tested with up to 4 input files.


For INDELs
----------

This is probably handled less delicately by vcf-merge, but still to be
investigated.

A tool by Jeroen first normalizes ('compresses') INDEL calls in VCF files,
this might be usefull to preprocess the VCF files before merging.
